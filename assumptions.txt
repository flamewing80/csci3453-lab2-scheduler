list of assumptions
time is incremented by one for each loop through the scheduler.run().advance() sequence
‘finish’ is the time passed from the beginning of the simulation until a given process moves from the running queue to the terminated queue
‘waiting’ is incremented by 0.5 during a context switch and 1.0 while a process waits in the ready queue while advance()-ing the scheduler
all process wait 0.5 during a context switch
‘turnaround’ is the difference between the finish time and the arrival time
‘response’ is the difference between the arrival time and the first time the process moves onto the running queue
in round robin, if a process completes during the middle of a quantum, a new process must wait until the end of the quantum before being moved onto the running queue
